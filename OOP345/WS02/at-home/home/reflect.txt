In this workshop, I could learn file stream that I forgot before and move semantics.
I could see how faster it was than regular copy constructor. I got to understand the concept, but it's a bit blurry to know the exact process of it.

The reason why move operations are faster than regular ones is the move constructor actually doesn't copy the rvalue object but, manipulate the address by move semantics.
That's why it's easy and fast to be done.


TMI) I couldn't submit lab part becasue of absence of the file that allows me to submit (command didn't work in the bash file)
Sorry Nathan but, I still feel a bit upset and victimized :(

2) What 2 things do you need to make a pure virtual function and describe what each does?

Keywords 'virtual' at the beginning and '=0' at the end.
'virtual' describes that the function is virtual function that represents abstract class.
'=0' means that it is PURE virtual function that the function doesn't work and cannot be assigned anything.

3) What are the 2 admissible types (types that allow for substitution) for a template's parameters?
