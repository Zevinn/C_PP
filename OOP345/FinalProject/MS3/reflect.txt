I like this Milestone until second one because it was good for me to practice and confirm what I know. 
But MS3's instruction poorly describes what I need to do that I had to figure out what to do in each function or creating object or module by myself.
I wish the description was more clear that I didn't have to get through this. :(
It was still a practice for me to understand the whole project and create it by myself. 

Thank you so much for teaching me Nathan!
I like your reasonable teaching and you try understanding students all the time.
I've learned so much from you. Thank you again!
