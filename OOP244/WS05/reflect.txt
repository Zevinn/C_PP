Workshop 05
I've learned about how to deal with overloaded operators that programmers can find very useful treating data when it comes to non-static data that they need to compare or calculate.
In order to provide convenience dealing with great deal of data and comparing the data, this will make programming more effecient and take less time to operate.
Once I define any operators depending on how I will use, it will become most useful tools for me and programmers to handle tasks.

1. The operator+ returns a Fraction object. Explain why this operator should
not return a reference to a Fraction object (like operator+=).

Because after the addition, the value shouldn't be in any variable unless we want it to be. 
In case of +=, the left operand should hold the result of addition. That's why we need to return the reference of the object.

2. List the temporary objects in the tester module (the temporary objects are
those that have no name and are removed from memory immediately after
their creation; put messages in the constructors/destructor to reveal them).

Fraction c, and other local variables I created to code effeciently, such as 'Fraction temp'

3. List the simplifications that you made to your class to minimize duplication.
Whenever I need to clarify if an object is empty, I call isEmpty function.
To code operator!=, I just call operator== and switch the result.
When I need to empty an object, I call constructor.
In the code of operator+=, I call operator+ to add the left operand and right operand.
