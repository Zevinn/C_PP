In this workshop, I generally found myself having hard time about the logic and I got confused most of time. 
I realized how much easy it was if I had thought about this task properly. In anyways, it meant a lot to me to learn and found this fact out.
I learned a constructor that sets object in empty state and it runs automatically beforehand and it's great function to use.

1) What is a safe empty state? Could you define another state as the safe empty state?
Safe empty state is literally the statement of an object is in empty space so that we can use the space filling out with other values.

2) Describe how you have minimized code duplication.
whenever I have to have the object in empty state, I just called a default contructor to make it empty.
when I want to check if the object is empty, I called isEmpty function to check and return if it's empty or not by bool.

3) Explain why the canTravelWith(...) member function can access the pri-vate data of the object referenced in its parameter.
the object that the canTravelWith is receiving has been declared as a private member of Traveler class where canTravelWith function is in as a member function.
A member function has an access to private member of the class, and the object has the access to it as well.
